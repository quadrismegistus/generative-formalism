# Part II: Methods and Analysis

This section presents the computational methods and analytical frameworks developed for measuring and comparing poetic form across human and AI-generated texts.

## Overview

Analyzing poetry computationally requires sophisticated methods that can capture both the surface features and deeper structural patterns of verse. This part covers:

1. **Prosodic Analysis Tools** - Computational methods for measuring rhyme, meter, and rhythm
2. **Comparative Frameworks** - Statistical approaches for comparing different corpora
3. **Validation Methods** - Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our measurements

## Core Methods

### Rhyme Detection
- **Phonetic analysis** - Using prosodic libraries to analyze sound patterns
- **End-rhyme identification** - Systematic detection of rhyming line endings
- **Rhyme scheme classification** - Automatically identifying formal rhyme patterns (ABAB, ABBA, etc.)
- **Quality assessment** - Measuring the strength and consistency of rhyme connections

### Metrical Analysis
- **Stress pattern detection** - Identifying stressed and unstressed syllables
- **Meter classification** - Recognizing common metrical patterns (iambic pentameter, etc.)
- **Regularity measurement** - Quantifying adherence to metrical norms

### Statistical Comparison
- **Distribution analysis** - Comparing the frequency of different formal features
- **Significance testing** - Statistical methods for identifying meaningful differences
- **Effect size estimation** - Measuring the practical significance of observed differences

## Technical Implementation

### Software Tools
- **prosodic** - Python library for phonetic and metrical analysis
- **Custom algorithms** - Specialized methods for poetry-specific features
- **Validation frameworks** - Systematic testing against known examples

### Performance Considerations
- **Scalability** - Methods that work efficiently on large corpora
- **Accuracy** - Balancing computational speed with analytical precision
- **Robustness** - Handling variations in text formatting and quality

## Methodological Challenges

Computational analysis of poetry faces several unique challenges:

- **Ambiguity** - Poetic language often involves intentional ambiguity
- **Historical variation** - Language changes over time affect pronunciation and stress patterns
- **Computational limitations** - Current NLP tools aren't optimized for poetic text
- **Subjective elements** - Some aspects of poetic quality resist quantification

## Validation and Reliability

We ensure methodological rigor through:

- **Human annotation** - Comparing computational results with expert human analysis
- **Cross-validation** - Testing methods on multiple datasets and time periods
- **Sensitivity analysis** - Understanding how parameter choices affect results
- **Reproducibility** - Providing complete code and documentation for all methods

The notebooks in this section demonstrate these methods in action, showing both their capabilities and limitations when applied to real poetic texts.
