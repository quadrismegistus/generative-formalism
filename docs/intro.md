# Introduction

## Background

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text across various domains, including poetry. However, despite their apparent fluency, questions remain about the quality and authenticity of AI-generated verse, particularly regarding formal poetic constraints like rhyme, meter, and traditional poetic structures.

This research investigates what we term the "formal stuckness" of AI verse - the tendency of language models to produce poetry that, while superficially competent, exhibits systematic limitations and patterns that distinguish it from human poetic composition.

## Research Questions

Our investigation addresses several key questions:

1. **How well do LLMs adhere to formal poetic constraints when generating verse?**
2. **What patterns emerge when comparing AI-generated poetry to historical poetic corpora?**
3. **To what extent do language models memorize existing poems versus generating novel compositions?**
4. **How do different prompting strategies affect the formal quality of generated poetry?**
5. **What computational tools can effectively measure and analyze prosodic features at scale?**

## Methodology

Our approach combines:

- **Corpus Analysis**: Systematic comparison of AI-generated poetry with historical poetic corpora
- **Prosodic Measurement**: Development and application of computational tools for measuring rhyme, meter, and other formal features
- **Controlled Generation**: Systematic prompting experiments to understand how different approaches affect poetic output
- **Statistical Analysis**: Quantitative methods for identifying patterns and differences between human and AI poetry

## Key Findings

Our research reveals several important insights:

- AI models show systematic biases in rhyme scheme selection and execution
- Generated poetry often exhibits "surface-level" adherence to form without deeper structural understanding
- Memorization plays a significant role in AI poetry generation, particularly for well-known works
- Different model architectures and prompting strategies produce notably different formal characteristics

## Implications

These findings have important implications for:

- **Computational Creativity**: Understanding the limitations and capabilities of AI in creative tasks
- **Digital Humanities**: Developing better tools for large-scale analysis of poetic texts
- **AI Ethics**: Recognizing when AI output relies on memorization versus original composition
- **Poetic Theory**: Informing debates about the nature of poetic form and creativity

## Using This Book

This book provides both the theoretical framework and practical tools for understanding AI poetry generation. Each section builds on previous work while remaining accessible to readers with different backgrounds and interests.

Whether you're a researcher in computational linguistics, a digital humanities scholar, or simply curious about AI creativity, this book offers insights and tools for exploring the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and poetic form.
