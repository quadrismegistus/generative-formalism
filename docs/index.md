# Generative Formalism

**On the formal stuckness of AI verse**

Welcome to the interactive companion to "Generative formalism: On the formal stuckness of AI verse". This Jupyter Book provides a comprehensive exploration of our research into how large language models generate poetry and the formal constraints they exhibit.

## Overview

This book presents a systematic analysis of artificial intelligence's approach to poetic composition, examining:

- **Historical Context**: How AI-generated poetry compares to historical poetic traditions
- **Formal Analysis**: Measurement and evaluation of rhyme schemes, meter, and other prosodic features
- **Computational Methods**: Tools and techniques for analyzing poetic form in large-scale datasets
- **Critical Findings**: Insights into the "stuckness" of AI verse and its implications for computational creativity

## Structure

The book is organized into four main parts:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation** - Building and preparing corpora of historical and AI-generated poetry
2. **Methods and Analysis** - Developing tools for measuring prosodic features and formal constraints
3. **Results and Analysis** - Presenting findings about AI poetry generation patterns
4. **Code Documentation** - Technical documentation of the research tools and methods

## Interactive Elements

This book contains fully executable notebooks that allow you to:

- Reproduce all analyses presented in the paper
- Explore the datasets interactively
- Experiment with the prosodic analysis tools
- Generate and analyze your own poetic examples

## Getting Started

If you're new to this research, we recommend starting with the [Introduction](intro.md) which provides background and context for the study. 

To dive into the technical details, begin with [Part I: Data Collection and Preparation](part-data.md).
